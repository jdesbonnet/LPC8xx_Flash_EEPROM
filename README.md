# LPC8xx_Flash_EEPROM

Example LPC8xx project to show how the 64 byte page flash in-application programming can be used to emulate 'EEPROM' (electrically erasable read-only-memory) function found in other MCUs.

This can be used, for example, to preserve settings or network node
addresses across power cycles. 

Currently compiles to just under 4KiB (without space optimication) so it should work with all the LPC8xx range of MCUs including the LPC810.

Enjoy,
